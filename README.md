# Inconsistent Failure of Expo Camera takePictureAsync after setCameraOptionsAsync

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where calling `takePictureAsync` after `setCameraOptionsAsync` sometimes fails to capture an image or returns an empty image. The failure is inconsistent, making debugging difficult.  The error messages provided are not very helpful in pinpointing the root cause.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a physical device or emulator.
4. Observe that attempts to take a picture after changing camera settings using `setCameraOptionsAsync` may result in a failure to capture the image or an empty image being captured.  The failure is not always reproducible and seems to be related to the timing of the settings changes and the call to `takePictureAsync`.

## Potential Causes

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  The asynchronous nature of `setCameraOptionsAsync` and `takePictureAsync` may lead to race conditions where the settings changes haven't fully propagated before the picture is attempted to be taken.
* **Internal State:** There might be an internal state in the Expo Camera API that's not properly updated after settings changes.
* **Device-Specific Issues:** The bug might be triggered more easily or only on certain devices.

## Solutions (Workarounds)

This issue has proven difficult to resolve definitively, thus the workaround focuses on mitigating the issue. The proposed solution introduces a delay between the setting changes and the picture capture. This allows the camera sufficient time to adjust the settings, minimizing the instances of this error.
