This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera settings.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `camera.takePictureAsync` method after changing camera settings using `camera.setCameraOptionsAsync`.  While the camera settings appear to update successfully, calling `takePictureAsync` results in an unexpected error, such as an empty image or a complete failure to capture the image. This is not consistently reproducible, making it difficult to debug. The error doesn't provide a clear explanation of the cause.  The exact error message varies depending on the device and Expo SDK version.
